# Wanderer_game
Java 2d game

My Java project, Wanderer the game
- Start the game by board.java
- Moving with arrows, attacking with space key
- Enemies get progressively harder with levels, although they are now set to little to no difficulty as i was testing.
- There is allready key mechanic implemented, you need to get key to get to antoher level, but you also have to kill all enemies so it is not fully used yet
- Update in near future with new dimension and with new type of enemy
- Monsters are moving on random every 2 moves of player himself
